      " Mutual Exclusion: When two people meet in the landings, they can’t just walk through because there is space only for one person. This condition to allow only one person (or process) to use the step between them (or the resource) is the first condition necessary for the occurrence of the deadlock. Hold and Wait: When the 2 people refuses to retreat and hold their grounds, it is called holding. This is the next necessary condition for the the deadlock. No Preemption: For resolving the deadlock one can simply cancel one of the processes for other to continue. But Operating System doesn’t do so. It allocates the resources to the processors for as much time needed until the task is completed. Hence, there is no temporary reallocation of the resources. It is third condition for deadlock. Circular Wait :When the two people refuses to retreat and wait for each other to retreat, so that they can complete their task, it is called circular wait. It is the last condition for the deadlock to occur. \n",

It specifies that the processes in the system form a circular list or a chain where each process in the chain is waiting for a resource held by next process in the chain.\n",

      " There are two types of fragmentation in OS which are given as: Internal fragmentation, and External fragmentation. Internal fragmentation happens when the memory is split into mounted sized blocks. Whenever a method request for the memory, the mounted sized block is allotted to the method. just in case the memory allotted to the method is somewhat larger than the memory requested, then the distinction between allotted and requested memory is that the Internal fragmentation. External fragmentation happens when there’s a sufficient quantity of area within the memory to satisfy the memory request of a method. however the process’s memory request cannot be fulfilled because the memory offered is during a non-contiguous manner. Either you apply first-fit or best-fit memory allocation strategy it’ll cause external fragmentation. \n",
